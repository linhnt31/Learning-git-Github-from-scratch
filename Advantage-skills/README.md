### Git flow and senario
**1. Senario**
> If you are working in one project that has many features
> We do not commit and push to ***master*** but create a **new branch**. Then, we review *commit* and ***merge*** them together.

2. **Commands**
* ***git branch***: creates a new branch
* ***git checkout***: switchs branchs
> To make it faster, we can combine 2 commands **branch** and **checkout** by: ***git checkout -b name_branch***
